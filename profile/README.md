<h2 align="center">Interactive LED Matrix Communication System</h2>

This project is a dynamic, web-managed communication system designed for the IEEE Computer Society at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayag√ºez Campus (UPRM). 

The goal is to improve how organizations communicate with members by replacing static methods (like flyers and whiteboards) with a modern, real-time digital display. Using a Raspberry Pi, the system shows announcements, events, and member-generated visuals in a compact and eye-catching format.

It features a user-friendly web application for content uploads and scheduling, an admin portal for content moderation and user management, and a backend system that validates and queues display content. This solution enhances member engagement, promotes sustainability by reducing paper use, and fits in small spaces where TVs are impractical.
